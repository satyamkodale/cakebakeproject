 here we are not inserting users via application so we are inserting users manually
 
 mysql> insert into roles(id, name)values(1,"ROLE_ADMIN"),(2,"ROLE_USER");
 
 here know we are inserting admin now bcoz we are not creating any master admin  and master password to create and manage admins
 if we want to to add master admin then we need cms who controls admin and user which is 3 step process 
 
 
 insert into users(id,email,password,first_name,last_name) values(1,'admin@gmail.com','$2a$10$moTjfAVBJzNS32q7NPPVh.iAGDbZSkjZJBkdxT5ZLKQ3R1Vh/y9Fi','Admin','gupta');
 
 
 
 password is 123456
